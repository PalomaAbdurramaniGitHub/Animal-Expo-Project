                    <h3>Dog</h3>
                    <p>Dog, (Canis lupus familiaris), domestic mammal of the family Canidae (order Carnivora). It is a subspecies of the gray wolf and is related to foxes and jackals. The dog is one of the two most ubiquitous and most popular domestic animals in the world. For more than 12,000 years it has lived with humans as a hunting companion, protector, and friend.The dog evolved from the gray wolf into more than 400 distinct breeds. Human beings have played a major role in creating dogs that fulfill distinct societal needs. Through the most rudimentary form of genetic engineering, dogs were bred to accentuate instincts that were evident from their earliest encounters with humans.</p>

                    <h3>Cat</h3>
                    <p>Cat, (Felis catus), domesticated member (felid) of the family Felidae. The family is generally divided between cats from the subfamily Pantherinae, which roar (including lions, tigers, and leopards), and cats from the subfamily Felinae, which purr instead (including cougars, bobcats, and domestic cats).
                    According to the latest research, purring likely stems from a special pad within the folds of a cat’s vocal cords, which adds an additional layer of fatty tissue that enables the folds to vibrate (purr) at low frequencies. Domestic cats are characterized by retractable claws, powerful bodies, acute senses, long tails, and specialized teeth adapted for hunting prey.</p>

                    <h3>Bird</h3>
                    <p>The debate over the origin of birds centres on whether birds descended directly from thecodont reptiles about 230 million years ago (during the Triassic Period) or from a later lineage, the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs. This debate has been long-standing and divisive. 
                    <br>
                    At the beginning of the 21st century, the pendulum has swung decisively toward the theropod ancestor hypothesis—that today’s birds are feathered dinosaurs. This hypothesis is supported by analyses of shared characteristics (synapomorphies) combined with improved samples of early bipedal theropods.</p>
